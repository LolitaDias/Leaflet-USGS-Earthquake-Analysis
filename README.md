# Leaflet - USGS-Earthquake-Analysis

#### Background

![1-Logo](Images/1-Logo.png)

 The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. 

The goal of this project was to use JavaScript to present an interactive map visualization of USGS earthquake data within a web page. Since the baseline data was provided in GeoJSON format, Leaflet was used to import and process the data, as well as generate the required visualization.

#### Questions

1. What are the locations and magnitudes of all earthquake events in the last twenty-four hours?
